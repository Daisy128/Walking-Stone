# Walking Stoneman

### Introduction

* The game is about moving the stoneman starts from the top left square of the board;
* To the bottom right corner which marked with a '*' symbol.

###Rules
* The stoneman on the framed square can be moved only horizontally or vertically.
* The stoneman on the unframed square can be moved only diagonally, until it lands on a framed square.
* The number in the squares specify the number of squares that the stoneman must step in a move.
* The stoneman is not allowed to leave the board.
* The yellow squares which show up on the board each time the stoneman moves mean the square it can take to be the next.
* Which means at the first time ,the stoneman should go to (0,4) or (4,0).
